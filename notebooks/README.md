### Note on notebooks
* I had used these nbs for research & testing.
* Most of them **will not execute** because of pathing issues (will have to add ../ to sys path) or because
the underlying code has changed. The utility of these notebooks is therefore limited.
* I am not deleting them, because some contain tidbits of research I may use later.
